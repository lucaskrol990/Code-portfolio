This was a project for the course "Optimization under Uncertainty"

The goal was to invest in a number of electricity generation technologies, which should minimize the sum of investment and operating costs whilst always meeting the electricity demand. Since the actual electricity generated by certain technologies, for example wind and solar, is stochastic we have to optimize under uncertainty.

To solve this, at first expected value solutions have been considered, which was used a lowerbound later on, with the result of the expected value (EEV) being used an upperbound. To try and solve the problem whilst taking the uncertainty into account a recourse model was considered and the L-shaped method has been to approximate this solution because of the high complexity.
