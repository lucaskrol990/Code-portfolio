This folder contains the ALNS algorithm as presented in the Master thesis "An ALNS algorithm for assigning officiating crews in the German American Football League"
which can be utilized to create assignments and ride-sharing routes to minimize the distance travelled by officials. 

For confidentiality reason, the German AFL data is not presented and instead only the data from the "Feasible Instances", with its construction method, is shown

The code can be run by running ALNS_feasible_instances.py. New data can be created by running AF_instances_feasible.py or .Rmd
