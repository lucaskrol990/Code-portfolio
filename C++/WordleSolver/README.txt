This is a leisure project based on the famous NYT wordle game.

The aim of the algorithm is to solve wordles on hard mode: you must use the information you have gotten. That means, if you know a green letter, you must use it at that spot for the next round and similarly for yellow letters. The algorithm's idea is pretty simply: all wordles which are still valid are saved and the next guessed word is chosen in such a way that it reveals the most information about the possible wordles.
